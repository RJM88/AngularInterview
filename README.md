# InterviewQuestions
****************IMPORTANT***********
Please don't commit your changes to the branch or make a branch out of the master. You should just work on these files locally and during the technical interview you will just share you screen with us. (If you create a branch or make commits all the other candidates will be able to see your solution.)
## Starting
You will have to run npm install to download the node_modules folder. Please message me if you have questions ryan.miskoviak@hach.com
## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
